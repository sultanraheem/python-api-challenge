# Notes

While completing this assignment, I encountered several challenges and errors, particularly with key errors and exporting data into the cities.csv file. Despite my best efforts, there are a few errors present in my final submission. I have attempted to resolve them to the best of my ability within the given timeframe.

I am looking forward to feedback on my work. If you have any suggestions for improvement or further sources for me to study, I am very open to learning from them.
