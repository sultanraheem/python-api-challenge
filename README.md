## Notes

During the completion of this assignment, I encountered several challenges, notably KeyErrors and issues exporting data to the `cities.csv` file. Despite thorough troubleshooting and multiple attempts to resolve these errors, some issues remain in this submission.

I have made every effort to address these challenges within the allotted timeframe and welcome any constructive feedback. Suggestions for improvement or additional resources to deepen my understanding would be greatly appreciated.
